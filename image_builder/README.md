# Building OreSat Linux images

Uses BeagleBoard's https://github.com/beagleboard/image-builder

## Files

- `chroot_scripts/early-oresat-chroot.sh`: The early chroot script, used to do anything before
  the image config ares parsed in chroot environment.
- `chroot_scripts/oresat-chroot.sh`: The main chroot script that runs after most packages are
  installed in chroot environment.
- `scripts/`: Helpful scripts that will be placed in `/opt/scripts/` in built images.
- `configs/*.conf`: All the image configs; defines what packages are install, system settings,
  etc.

## How it Works

**NOTE:** Most of the build process is handled by BeagleBoard's image-builder, with some custom
OreSat scripts executed at specific moments.

- U-Boot bootloader is compiled.
- All device tree overlays are compiled.
- A temp directory is made, the directory is mounted with chroot.
- OreSat's early chroot script is executed (all device tree overlay binaries are copied over).
- A bunch of BeagleBoard's scripts are executed to build the image; including installing all Debian
  and Python packages. Basically most things defined in the image `.conf` file happen during
  this step.
- OreSat's custom chroot script is executed.
- Chroot environment is exited.
- A partition is made on the system.
- All files from the temp directory are copied over to the new partition.
- U-Boot image is added to partition.
- A `.img` file is made from the partition.
- The `.img` file is compressed with zst.
- A SHA-256 is generated for the `.img.zst`.

## Requirements

- Image must be built on a device running Debian or a Debian-based distro.
- An internet connection (it has to call `apt` a lot).
- U-boot requires cross compilation if outside of ARMv7 environment (i.e. arm-none-eabi-gcc). 

## Set up

Install dependencies

```bash
$ sudo apt install git zstd device-tree-compiler make cpp m4 gcc dosfstools kpartx wget parted tree bc
```

Clone the oresat-linux repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/oresat/oresat-linux
```

## Build Image

```bash
$ cd oresat-linux/image_builder/
$ ./build_images.sh <board>
```

Where `<board>` can be:

- `c3`: The flight image for OreSat's C3 board.
- `cfc`: The flight image for OreSat's CFC (Cirrus Flux Camera) board.
- `dev`: A general image for development.
- `dxwifi`: The flight image for the OreSat DxWiFi board.
- `generic`: A generic minimal flight-like image for any OreSat board.
- `gps`: The flight image the OreSat's GPS board.
- `star-tracker`: The flight image for the OreSat's Star Tracker board.
